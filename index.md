### Welcome to My Page.
My name is Dustin Wojciechowski. I am a software engineer that has worked within a couple of different domains. My current interest is in XR: VR, AR, and Mixed Reality.
My target platform for VR projects is currently the Oculus Quest 2, and IPhone for AR projects.
I build most of my projects using Unity3D.

### More info about my XR Apps (Youtube clips coming soon!).
<u>VR Projects Approaching Completion:</u>
1. Not Another Zombie Wave Shooter - My take on the genre. As a soldier in a zombie-infested city, it is up to you to activate five different mobile communications devices in order to call a helicopter for evacuation. 
2. Interview & Presentation Simulator - An offline experience to practice for an upcoming presentation or a job interview! Presentation mode allows for you to upload a PowerPoint presentation in front of a group of office workers. Interview Mode puts you in a small room with another person who will ask you common behavioral questions as well as coding problems that will require you to code on a virtual whiteboard! Your answers will be recorded and available for playback so you can review and improve!

<u>AR Projects:</u>
1. Tiny Car - Select surface, and then spawn a little car that you can drive around using touch controls!
